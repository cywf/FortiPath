# Task: 002 - Update Python Dependencies

## Objective

Update `requirements.txt` with all necessary Python dependencies with pinned versions for FortiPath's core functionality. This ensures reproducible builds and clear dependency management.

## Requirements

- [ ] Review existing `requirements.txt` file
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are still needed
- [ ] Pin all dependencies to specific versions
- [ ] Add any missing dependencies for planned features
- [ ] Document purpose of each major dependency section
- [ ] Test installation in clean virtual environment
- [ ] Update documentation with any new setup requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Current Dependencies to Review

The existing `requirements.txt` includes:
- Core HTTP and Web Scraping (requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml)
- Google Maps API integration (googlemaps)
- Data Analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- OSINT and Security Tools (python-whois, dnspython)
- AI/ML Integration (openai)
- Communication (python-telegram-bot, slack-sdk)
- Report Generation (reportlab, python-docx, markdown)
- Database Support (sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, alembic)
- Configuration Management (python-dotenv, pyyaml)
- And many more...

### Version Pinning Strategy

Use exact version pinning for production stability:
```
requests==2.31.0
beautifulsoup4==4.12.0
```

### Compatibility Testing

Test with multiple Python versions:
- Python 3.8 (minimum)
- Python 3.11 (recommended)
- Python 3.12 (latest)

### Dependencies Categories

Group dependencies by purpose:
1. Core functionality
2. Development tools (testing, linting)
3. Optional features
4. Platform-specific requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All dependencies have pinned versions
- [ ] Requirements file is organized with clear sections and comments
- [ ] Installation tested in clean virtual environment
- [ ] No dependency conflicts
- [ ] All existing scripts can import required modules
- [ ] Documentation updated with any new requirements
- [ ] Compatible with Python 3.8+

## Status

**Not Started** ðŸ“‹

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (Spec-Kit Integration) should be complete

## Estimated Effort

**Total:** 2-3 hours
- Review and audit: 1 hour
- Version pinning and testing: 1 hour
- Documentation: 30 minutes

## Related Files

- `requirements.txt` - Main dependency file
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation
- `.specify/spec.md` - Technical specifications

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Create clean virtual environment
python3 -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify key imports
python -c "import requests, openai, pandas, reportlab"

# Deactivate and cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf test_env
```

## Notes

This is a foundational task for Phase 1 of the FortiPath development plan. Having properly managed dependencies is critical for:
- Reproducible builds
- Security (known versions can be scanned for vulnerabilities)
- Collaboration (all developers use same versions)
- Deployment (consistent production environments)

Consider using additional tools in the future:
- `pip-tools` for dependency compilation
- `poetry` for advanced dependency management
- `pipenv` for combined virtual environment and dependency management
