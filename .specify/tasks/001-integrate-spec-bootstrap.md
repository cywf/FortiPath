# Task: 001 - Integrate Spec-Bootstrap Framework

## Objective

Integrate the spec-bootstrap template framework into FortiPath to enable specification-driven development. This establishes the foundation for organized, documented, and transparent development processes.

## Requirements

- [x] Create `.specify/` directory structure
- [x] Write `constitution.md` with FortiPath-specific principles
- [x] Write `spec.md` with comprehensive technical specifications
- [x] Write `plan.md` with implementation roadmap
- [x] Create `tasks/` directory with example task
- [ ] Add spec-kit GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Add markdown link checker configuration
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` with spec-kit best practices
- [ ] Update root README.md to reference spec-kit structure
- [ ] Create `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml` for markdown validation

## Implementation Notes

### Spec-Kit Framework Components

1. **Constitution** - Defines project principles, governance, and non-negotiable rules
   - Security-first approach
   - Multi-language architecture justification
   - Testing and quality standards
   - Community standards

2. **Specifications** - Technical requirements and architecture
   - System architecture
   - Core features specifications
   - Non-functional requirements
   - API specifications
   - Data models and formats

3. **Plan** - Implementation roadmap and task management
   - 7 development phases
   - 16-week timeline
   - Success metrics
   - Risk management

4. **Tasks** - Individual, actionable work items
   - Clear objectives
   - Requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Implementation notes
   - Status tracking

### Integration Approach

- Preserve existing FortiPath structure (scripts/, infra/, docs/)
- Add `.specify/` directory alongside existing structure
- Integrate spec-kit validation workflow with existing workflows
- Update documentation to reference specification framework
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Benefits

- **Transparency** - All development is documented and traceable
- **Organization** - Clear structure for planning and execution
- **Collaboration** - Easy for contributors to understand and participate
- **Quality** - Specifications ensure features meet requirements
- **AI-Friendly** - Enables AI agents to work within defined specifications

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.specify/` directory created with proper structure
- [x] `constitution.md` completed and reviewed
- [x] `spec.md` completed with all major features specified
- [x] `plan.md` completed with 16-week roadmap
- [x] Example task created (this file)
- [ ] Spec-kit workflow added and passing
- [ ] Markdown validation configured
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated
- [ ] README.md updated to explain spec-kit integration
- [ ] All specification files pass markdown linting

## Status

**In Progress** üî®

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Directory structure created
- ‚úÖ Constitution written
- ‚úÖ Specifications documented
- ‚úÖ Implementation plan created
- ‚úÖ Example task created

### Remaining
- ‚è≥ Add spec-kit workflow
- ‚è≥ Configure markdown validation
- ‚è≥ Update supporting files
- ‚è≥ Validate and test

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundational task for the spec-kit integration.

## Estimated Effort

**Total:** 1 day
- Constitution: 2 hours
- Specifications: 3 hours
- Plan: 2 hours
- Workflow setup: 1 hour
- Documentation updates: 1 hour
- Testing and validation: 1 hour

## Related Files

- `.specify/constitution.md` - Project principles
- `.specify/spec.md` - Technical specifications
- `.specify/plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `.specify/tasks/` - Task directory
- `.github/workflows/spec-kit.yml` - Validation workflow (to be added)
- `README.md` - Main documentation (to be updated)

## Notes

This task represents Phase 0 of the FortiPath development plan. It establishes the specification framework that will guide all subsequent development work.

The spec-kit approach ensures that:
1. Development is intentional and documented
2. Features are designed before implementation
3. Progress is tracked transparently
4. Collaboration is facilitated
5. AI agents can work within clear specifications
