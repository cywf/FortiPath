### 3. Codebase Analysis

**File:** [`docs/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md)

A thorough analysis revealing:

**Current State:**
- 116+ TODO items across the codebase
- Most scripts are templates or pseudocode
- Rust modules have compilation errors (missing dependencies)
- Zero test coverage
- No CI/CD for testing or security scanning
- Good architectural foundation but incomplete implementation

**Breakdown by Component:**
- **Python Scripts:** Templates with basic CLI, need API integrations
- **Rust OSINT Crawler:** Won't compile, needs dependencies and implementation
- **Terraform Infrastructure:** Basic structure, incomplete modules
- **Terraform Provider:** Go modules not initialized
- **Documentation:** Good foundation, needs updates for actual features

**Viability:** ‚úÖ **HIGHLY VIABLE** - Excellent architecture, clear scope, needs focused development

---

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure

**Files Created:**
- `.gitignore` - Excludes build artifacts from version control
- `requirements.txt` - Complete Python dependency specification
- Updated `README.md` - Development status and documentation links

---

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. ‚úÖ **Well-structured repository** with clear separation of concerns
2. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive scope** covering all major EP aspects
3. ‚úÖ **Modern tech stack** (Python, Rust, Go, Terraform)
4. ‚úÖ **Good documentation foundation** with wiki and guides
5. ‚úÖ **Active community structure** (issues, discussions, project boards)

### Critical Gaps
1. ‚ùå **116+ incomplete TODO items** requiring implementation
2. ‚ùå **No dependency management** (empty Cargo.toml, missing requirements.txt)
3. ‚ùå **No testing infrastructure** (0% code coverage)
4. ‚ùå **Most code is pseudocode** rather than functional implementations
5. ‚ùå **No API integrations** (Google Maps, OpenAI, OSINT sources)
6. ‚ùå **Outdated components** (Rust 2018 edition, deprecated GitHub Actions syntax)

## Resource Requirements

### External Services & APIs Needed

| Service | Purpose | Est. Cost/Month |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Google Maps API | Route planning, location assessment | $200 (or free with OpenStreetMap) |
| OpenAI API | AI-powered report generation | $50-200 |
| ZeroTier API | Network management | Free for small networks |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD automation | Free for public repos |

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** $50-400 (depending on API choices)

### Development Team

**Recommended:**
- 1-2 Full-stack developers (Python/Rust/Go)
- 0.5 DevOps engineer (part-time)
- 0.5 Technical writer (part-time)
- 0.25 Security specialist (code review)

**Or:** 1-2 versatile full-stack developers with broad skill set

### Timeline

**Total Effort:** 20-22 weeks of development work  
**With Parallelization:** 16 weeks (with 1-2 developers)  
**Target:** FortiPath v1.0.0 production release

## Key Decisions Required

### 1. Google Maps vs OpenStreetMap
**Recommendation:** Start with OpenStreetMap (free), add Google Maps as premium option

**Rationale:**
- OSM is free and privacy-friendly
- Google Maps has better quality but requires paid API key
- Supporting both provides flexibility

### 2. Rust vs Python for OSINT Crawler
**Recommendation:** Keep Rust for crawler core, Python for data processing

**Rationale:**
- Rust provides security and performance for web crawling
- Python easier for data analysis and integration
- Current Rust structure is salvageable with dependency updates

### 3. Self-Hosted vs Cloud Deployment
**Recommendation:** Support both deployment models

**Rationale:**
- EP agencies may require on-premises for security
- Cloud offers easier scaling and maintenance
- Flexibility increases adoption
