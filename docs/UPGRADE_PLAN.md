# FortiPath Upgrade and Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to revive and modernize the FortiPath executive protection toolkit, which has been dormant for approximately 3 years. The plan addresses incomplete features, outdated components, and the integration of modern automation and AI capabilities while maintaining security best practices.

**Current State:** FortiPath v0.1.0 (Last updated: August 2023)  
**Target State:** FortiPath v1.0.0 (Production-ready release)  
**Timeline:** 12-16 weeks (see detailed milestones below)

---

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Findings Summary

#### Strengths
1. **Well-Structured Repository:** Clear separation of concerns (scripts, infrastructure, docs)
2. **Comprehensive Scope:** Covers all major EP aspects (advance surveys, OSINT, communications, etc.)
3. **Multi-Language Architecture:** Python for scripts, Rust for performance-critical tasks, Go for Terraform provider
4. **Good Documentation Foundation:** README, wiki structure, and contributing guidelines exist

#### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Incomplete Implementations:**
   - **116+ TODO items** across Python, Rust, and Go codebases
   - Most scripts are pseudocode or basic templates without real functionality
   - Rust OSINT crawler has compilation errors (missing dependencies)
   - Route planning and location assessment scripts only contain pseudocode
   - No actual API integrations (Google Maps, OSINT sources, AI services)

2. **Missing Dependencies:**
   - No `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
   - Rust `Cargo.toml` files are empty (no dependencies listed)
   - Go modules not initialized for Terraform provider
   - Outdated Rust edition (2018, should be 2021)

3. **No Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Zero test files found
   - No CI/CD for testing
   - No linting or code quality checks

4. **Security Concerns:**
   - No input validation in scripts
   - API keys hardcoded in pseudocode examples
   - No secrets management strategy
   - Missing security scanning in CI/CD

5. **Outdated Components:**
   - Rust edition 2018 (current: 2021)
   - GitHub Actions using deprecated syntax (`::set-output`)
   - No dependency version pinning

6. **Documentation Gaps:**
   - Forward-looking wiki (describes features not yet implemented)
   - No API documentation
   - Missing deployment guides
   - No user guides for actual usage

---

## Upgrade Strategy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Full Automation:** Every manual process should be automated where possible
2. **Security First:** All implementations must follow security best practices
3. **Production Ready:** Code should be testable, maintainable, and deployable
4. **User-Centric:** Documentation and UX should enable easy adoption
5. **Incremental Delivery:** Ship working features progressively

### Technology Stack Decisions

#### Keep Multi-Language Approach (with refinement)
- **Python:** Remains primary for scripts, report generation, API integrations (easy to maintain, rich ecosystem)
- **Rust:** For OSINT crawler and performance-critical tasks (security, speed, memory safety)
- **Go:** For Terraform provider only (Terraform's native language)

**Rationale:** Each language serves a specific purpose. Python's ecosystem makes it ideal for rapid development and API integration. Rust provides security and performance for web crawling. Go is necessary for Terraform provider development.

   - **Recommendation:** Start with OSM, add Google Maps as premium option

2. **Rust vs Python for OSINT Crawler**
   - **Current:** Rust (performance, security)
   - **Alternative:** Python (easier maintenance, rich libraries)
   - **Recommendation:** Keep Rust for crawler core, use Python for data processing

3. **Self-Hosted vs Cloud Services**
   - **Self-Hosted Pro:** Full control, no recurring costs
   - **Self-Hosted Con:** Maintenance burden, uptime responsibility
   - **Cloud Pro:** Easy scaling, high availability
   - **Cloud Con:** Recurring costs
   - **Recommendation:** Support both deployment models
