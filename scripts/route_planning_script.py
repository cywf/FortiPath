# Pseudocode for Advanced Route Planning Script

# - Multiple Points of Interest: The script could take multiple points of interest as input and plan a route that visits all of them in the most efficient order. This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem and can be solved using various algorithms.

# - Real-Time Updates: The script could continuously monitor the route during the journey and provide real-time updates based on changing conditions. For example, if a road closure or traffic jam is detected ahead, the script could reroute to a backup route.

# - Integration with Other Systems: The script could integrate with other systems used by the protection team. For example, it could send alerts or updates to a communication system, or log route data in a database for future analysis.

# Import necessary libraries
import googlemaps
import risk_assessment_tool
import communication_system
import database_system

# Define start and end locations and points of interest
start_location = "123 Main St, Anytown, USA" # change to actual start location
end_location = "456 Elm St, Anytown, USA" # change to actual end location
points_of_interest = ["789 Pine St, Anytown, USA", "321 Oak St, Anytown, USA"] # change to actual points of intrests

# Initialize Google Maps client
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='your-google-maps-api-key') # change to your api key 

# Generate potential routes that visit all points of interest
routes = generate_routes(start_location, end_location, points_of_interest, gmaps)

# Assess risk and efficiency of each route
for route in routes:
    route['risk_score'] = risk_assessment_tool.assess_route(route)
    route['efficiency_score'] = calculate_efficiency(route)

# Sort routes by risk and efficiency
routes.sort(key=lambda route: (route['risk_score'], -route['efficiency_score']))

# Output recommended routes
print("Recommended Primary Route:", routes[0])
print("Recommended Backup Route:", routes[1])

# Start journey with primary route
current_route = routes[0]

# Monitor route during journey
while not journey_completed():
    # Check for changes in conditions
    if check_for_changes(current_route, gmaps):
        # If changes detected, reroute to backup route
        current_route = routes[1]
        print("Switching to backup route due to changes in conditions.")
    
    # Send real-time updates to communication system
    communication_system.send_update(current_route)

    # Log route data in database
    database_system.log_route_data(current_route)

# End of journey
print("Journey completed.")
