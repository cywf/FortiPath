# Estate_Security_Plan.py

"""
Estate Security Plan Script

Purpose:
This script is designed to generate a comprehensive security plan for an estate or property.
The user is prompted to provide details about the estate's physical security measures, surveillance systems, 
access controls, and any other relevant security details. The script then compiles this information into a 
formatted report, which can be printed or saved for future reference.

Usage:
Run the script and follow the prompts to input the necessary security details for the estate. 
At the end, a security plan report will be generated and displayed.
