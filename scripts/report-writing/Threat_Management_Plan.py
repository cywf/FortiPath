# Threat_Management_Plan.py

"""
Threat Management Plan Script

Purpose:
This script aids in the creation of a Threat Management Plan. After identifying and analyzing threats, it's 
essential to develop a comprehensive plan to manage and mitigate those threats. This script will guide the user 
through a series of prompts to capture strategies, actions, and resources required to address the identified threats.

Usage:
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to input details about the strategies and actions to be taken 
against the identified threats. Upon completion, a detailed Threat Management Plan will be generated and displayed.

Note:
This script is intended to assist in drafting Threat Management Plans. Users should review and finalize the 
generated plan before implementing or sharing.
