# Protective_Intel_Analysis_Summaries.py

"""
Protective Intel Analysis Summaries Script

Purpose:
This script is designed to assist in the creation of summaries based on gathered intelligence pertinent 
to the protection detail. Intelligence can come from various sources, such as OSINT, surveillance reports, 
or informants. The script prompts the user to input the raw intelligence data and then structures it into 
a concise and actionable summary, ensuring that the protection team is informed of any potential threats 
or relevant information.

Usage:
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to input the raw intelligence data. Upon completion, 
a protective intel analysis summary will be generated and displayed.
