"""
Travel Security Read-Aheads Script

Purpose:
This script is designed to assist in the creation of pre-travel briefings that highlight potential security concerns 
for a specific destination. It aims to provide the traveler or protection detail with a comprehensive understanding 
of the security landscape they might encounter. The script prompts the user to input details about the destination, 
known threats, local customs, and other relevant information, then structures it into a concise and actionable briefing.

Usage:
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to input details about the travel destination and any known security concerns. 
Upon completion, a Travel Security Read-Ahead briefing will be generated and displayed.
