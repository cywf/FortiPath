# Threat_Analysis.py

"""
Threat Analysis Script

Purpose:
This script is designed to facilitate the process of analyzing identified threats in detail. Threat Analysis is a 
critical step that follows Threat Assessment. It delves deeper into the nature, capabilities, intentions, and 
modus operandi of the identified threats. This script will guide the user through a series of prompts to capture 
key details about the threat's background, historical activities, affiliations, and potential targets.

Usage:
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to input comprehensive details about the threat. Upon completion, 
a detailed Threat Analysis report will be generated and displayed.

Note:
This script is intended to assist in drafting Threat Analyses. Users should review and finalize the generated report 
before sharing or archiving.
