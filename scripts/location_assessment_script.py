# Pseudocode for Advanced Location Assessment Script

# - Inputs: The script would take as input a location, which could be provided as an address or GPS coordinates.

# - Location Data API: The script would use a location data API, such as the Google Places API, to gather information about the location. This could include details about the building, the surrounding area, and so on.

# - Risk Assessment: The script could integrate with a risk assessment API or dataset to evaluate the security of the location. This could involve checking the crime rate in the area, the presence of security measures at the location, and so on.

# - Safe Zone Identification: The script could use mapping and building layout data to identify potential safe zones within the location. This could involve identifying areas with good visibility, multiple exits, or other desirable features.

# - Exit Location: The script could use mapping and building layout data to identify all potential exits from the location.

# - Output: The script would output a security assessment for the location, which could include a risk score, a list of potential safe zones and exits, and detailed information about potential risks.

# Import necessary libraries
import googlemaps
import risk_assessment_tool
import mapping_tool

# Define location
location = "123 Main St, Anytown, USA" # change to your actual location

# Initialize Google Maps client
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='your-google-maps-api-key') # change to your API key 

# Gather information about the location
location_info = gmaps.place(location)

# Assess risk of the location
risk_score = risk_assessment_tool.assess_location(location_info)

# Identify safe zones and exits
safe_zones = mapping_tool.identify_safe_zones(location_info)
exits = mapping_tool.identify_exits(location_info)

# Output security assessment
print("Risk Score for", location, ":", risk_score)
print("Safe Zones:", safe_zones)
print("Exits:", exits)
