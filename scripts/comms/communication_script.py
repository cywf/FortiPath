# Pseudocode for Advanced Coordination with Local Authorities Script

# -------- OVERVIEW ----------- #

# - Inputs: The script would take as input a location, which could be provided as an address or GPS coordinates, and the principal's schedule.

# - Local Authority Data API: The script would use a local authority data API, such as a police or fire department API, to gather information about local law enforcement or security forces. This could include details about the nearest police station, fire station, hospital, and so on.

# - Communication: The script could use the FreeTAKServer API to send a message to the local authorities informing them of the principal's visit and requesting any necessary coordination. This could include sharing the principal's schedule, the results of location assessments, or other relevant information.

# - Output: The script would output a confirmation that the message has been sent, along with any response received from the local authorities.

# Import necessary libraries
import local_authority_api
import freetakserver

# Define location and principal's schedule
location = "123 Main St, Anytown, USA"
schedule = "Principal's schedule"

# Gather information about local authorities
local_authorities = local_authority_api.get_local_authorities(location)

# Send message to local authorities
message = "The principal will be visiting " + location + " as per the following schedule: " + schedule + ". Please let us know if any coordination is needed."
response = freetakserver.send_message(local_authorities['contact_info'], message)

# Output response
print("Message sent to local authorities. Response:", response)
